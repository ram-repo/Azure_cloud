### work item: [Refer here for more](./images/work_item.md)
    You add work items to plan and manage your project. You use different types of work items to track different types of workâ€”such as user stories or product backlog items, tasks, bugs, or issues. You can describe the work to be done, assign work, track status, and coordinate efforts within your team.


### Boards
    Azure Boards provides you with a set of predefined work item types to support tracking features, user stories, bugs, and tasks. You can quickly get up and running by using your product backlog or Kanban board. ... Quickly add work items by using your backlog or Kanban board

### Queries   [refer here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/queries/using-queries?view=azure-devops)
    Managed queries generate a list of work items based on the filter criteria you provide. You can create queries from the web portal or from a supported client, such as Visual Studio Team Explorer and Team Explorer Everywhere. Also, you can open a query in Excel to perform bulk additions and modifications.



## Dashboard:
    Gain visibility into your team's progress by adding one or more widgets or charts to your dashboard. Customizable, highly-configurable dashboards provide you and your teams with the flexibility to share information, monitor progress and trends, and improve your workflow processes. Each team can tailor their dashboards to share information and monitor their progress.

* After you define it, you have a prioritized list of features and requirements to build. Your backlog also provides a repository of all the information you need to track and share with your team.

* Your backlog consists of a list of work items. You use work items to share information, assign work to team members, track dependencies, organize work, and more. Because the most important work appears at the top of the list, your team always knows what to work on next.


### ``` Prerequisites ```
